For my senior design project, I will be working a project sponsored by Midea: developing a system that matches receipts with corresponding bank statement transactions. The goal of this project is to ensure that purchases are properly verified, classified, and stored in a Vendor Expense Claim sheet. From my perspective, this project demonstrates how computer science, AI/ML specifically, can be applied to a practical financial workflow problem that many businesses face. It incorporates many areas of my academic interest, including natural language processing, database systems, and software design. By automating the detection of missing or mismatched receipts, the project helps improve both accuracy and efficiency in financial record keeping. This combination of technical application and real-world usefulness makes the project meaningful and challenging.

My coursework has provided me with the technical foundation necessary to contribute to this project. In **Software Eng**, I gained valuable knowledge on project management. This will be extremely important in making sure project tasks are manageable and get done within project timeline. For managing huge database of training datas and building knowledge base, **Database Mgmt** will help me to build a well structured and efficient database. As for system design, **Deep Learning** and **Intelligent Data Analysis** are course that I'm taking to better prepare myself for finetuning LLM or OCR model, which are core to our project.

My co-op experiences have further prepared me for the challenges of this project by allowing me to apply classroom knowledge in real-world settings. Having three semesters at Medpace as a **software development intern**, I learned how to collaborate within a large development team and gained practical skills in building and maintaining scalable applications. These roles also developed my non-technical skills, including communication, project management, and adapting to fast-changing priorities. I believe these experiences will help me not only to develop application but also to ensure our team stays aligned and productive throughout the project.

I am motivated to work on this project because it represents the intersection of computer science and a real-world application in many industries. I am excited by the opportunity to use my skills to solve a problem that is both practical and widely relevant. The project also aligns with my career interests in data analysis and artificial intelligence, giving me the chance to gain deeper hands-on experience in applying these tools. Furthermore, I enjoy the process of automating tedious manual tasks, and this project provides a perfect opportunity to do that. Knowing that the system could one day help businesses reduce errors and save time motivates me to put in the effort needed to create a reliable solution.

Our preliminary approach to designing the system will begin with building receipt-to-bank-statement matching using Python, integrating a Image Recognition system to extract targeted data, from there using NLP techniques to handle text differences between documents. we plan to then apply classification models to categorize purchases, using AWS or Mideaâ€™s internal AI tools for additional support. Finally, we will design an automated pipeline that outputs results into a Vendor Expense Claim Excel sheet using tools like pandas and openpyxl. We expect the results to include a functional program that accurately matches receipts, flags mismatches, categorizes purchases, and generates clean financial reports. To evaluate my own contributions, I will track accuracy rates, code quality, and whether the system works end-to-end with minimal errors. I will know I have done a good job when my part of the project is well-documented, reliable, and makes a measurable contribution to the overall team effort.
