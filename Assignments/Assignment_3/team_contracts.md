# UC 2025 CS Capstone Team Contract

## Team members:
- **Chau Nguyen** - Computer Science Senior // nguye2cu@mail.uc.edu 
- **Tiep Tran** - Computer Science Senior // tran2tp@mail.uc.edu 
- **Jack Nguyen** - Computer Science Senior // nguye2lo@mail.uc.edu 

## Expected timing and frequency of team meetings: 
- Twice a week, 1-2 hours for each meeting.

## Project focus:

### Problem 
  - During a lecture, you might miss some important professor note -> You record the lecture audio -> Plain MP3 lecture audio file is so hard to work with (not easy to find a concept, have to scroll back and forward, no transcript, background audio on top of the lecture).
### Proposed Solution 
  - An app that takes in the MP3 audio file, performs audio diarization/segmentation (isolates only the professor's voice), speech to text, and a chatbot based on processed lecture knowledge base.
### Proposed Stack
  - AI models: speaker dizaration model (speaker recognition), speech-to-text model, LLM
  - Database for parsed lecture note knowledge base
  - Web app for user interactivity
