Our senior design project focuses on developing an application that can take audio recordings of lectures and automatically turn them into organized notes. The goal is to help students who struggle to keep up with note taking during class which is something I have personally experienced. Our approach is to perform speaker diarization to isolate the professorâ€™s voice, followed by speech-to-text processing to generate editable notes. These notes will then be stored in a knowledge base, which allows students to review past lectures and interact with a chatbot for review and study purposes. From my academic perspective, this project combines different concepts from machine learning, databases, and software engineering to create a useful tool. I believe this application has the potential to help improve the way students study by making lecture content more accessible, organized, and easier to retain.

The classes I have taken at UC have provided me with a strong foundation for this project. Last spring, I took Software Engineering, where I learned about the software development life cycle, including best practices for design, testing, and more. I believe the skills gained in this course will help us organize and manage the project effectively. I am currently taking Deep Learning and Intelligent Systems, where I am learning about machine learning models, neural networks, and AI techniques. The knowledge from these courses will be directly applicable for speaker diarization and speech-to-text processing to generate organized lecture notes. These courses, along with others I have taken, provide me with strong technical and problem-solving skills to contribute effectively to this project.

My co-op experiences have provided me with the hands-on skills necessary to contribute to this senior design project. At Wells Fargo, as a Software Engineering Intern, I worked on building an LLM agent to process ServiceNow alerts, summarize them, and suggest next steps. I also helped design and orchestrate a multi-agent system to automate vulnerability ticket workflows. This experience in building and managing intelligent agents gives me relevant skills for this project. During my co-ops at Kinetic Vision as a Software Engineering Intern, I gained full-stack development experience, using technologies like React.js and GraphQL to build robust and reliable applications. These experiences will guide my contributions to the development and implementation of our project. Beyond technical experience, my co-op roles also strengthened my problem-solving and collaboration skills.

I am motivated to work on this project because it addresses a challenge that I have faced frequently as a student. Often, I struggled to balance listening to the professor and taking notes in a way that would help me review effectively after class. Additionally, this project combines many areas I am interested in and aligns closely with my technical interests. It also provides a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience in areas where I have less experience, such as speaker diarization and speech-to-text processing. I am excited to apply my skills while creating a project that is both meaningful and impactful. What excites me most is that this project can be helpful not just to me, but to many other students who face the same challenges in their learning.

For this project, my preliminary approach will start with processing lecture audio by isolating the professor's voice using speaker diarization. From there, we will apply speech-to-text to convert the audio into editable notes, which will be stored in a database as a knowledge base for later retrieval. We plan to build a chatbot using an LLM to allow students to interact with the lecture content. I expect the final application to allow students to upload an audio recording and transform it into organized notes, as well as review the content efficiently. I plan to evaluate the application by testing how reliably it converts lecture audio into accurate notes. I will know I have done a good job when my work is complete and contributes to a functional system that meets the goals of our project.
