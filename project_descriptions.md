## Main Project: Bank statement and receipt matching automated system (Midea sponsored - PENDING APPROVAL)

- **Project topic of area**: *This project is sponsored by Midea America Research Center (Pending Approval)*. The project will focus creating a system that automate the matching of bank statement and receipts using NLP and Image Processing Model. In addition to the matching, we also need to extract information about the transaction (types of transaction, amount, ...) and develop an alert workflow in case the amount does not match.   

## Backup Project: Lecture Saver - A system for processing lecture audio and note taking 

- **Project topic of area**: *This is our backup project in case the above project does not get approved*. This project basis is an application for student to record lecture audio and then saved the content into a knowldege base for review. In this project we will focus on developing an application that perform speaker diarization (audio segmentation) to extract professors speech from an audio recording (mp3 file), after which we can perform speech to text on to get the transcript. With the saved transcript we can now build an agentic workflow on top of the knowledge base for note taking, lecture review or recalling purposes.
