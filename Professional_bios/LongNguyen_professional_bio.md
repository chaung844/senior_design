## Previous Experience
Through my co-ops and internships here at UC, I have:
 - Tutor at iCode Edu (June 2023 - July 2023): Taught children on how to make a game with Unity and C#. 
 - Researcher at Discovery Lab Global (Dec 2023 - May 2024): Worked with a small team to research how to make an AI agent and how to apply said agent to be able to play the game Pong (Python).
 - Intern at Unit Technologies Vietnam (August 2024 - December 2024): Studied about automating system administration using Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the Ansible Automation Platform (RHEL, Bash)
 - And also through a couple of EEPs, I learned on my own how to make sprite sheets and make a game using Godot and Game Maker Studio.

## Project Sought
As you could probably tell from my experiences, I am passionate about making a game. I haven't been disciplined enough to make one on my own, but my hope is that through the structure of the class and a team, I will be able to make a small game to help solve a problem somehow. Aside from this I am also open to project ideas that involve AI or Deep Learning.
