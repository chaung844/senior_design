### Project Sought
I am seeking a capstone project centered on AI/agent-based solutions, with a focus on exploring new applications of LLMs, multi-agent systems, and full-stack development to create innovative, scalable tools. I am also eager to work with new frameworks and gain hands-on experience while contributing to a project that delivers meaningful real-world impact.
