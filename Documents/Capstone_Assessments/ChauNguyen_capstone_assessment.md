Our senior design project, which is sponsored by Midea, focuses on developing an application to cross check receipts with bank statements. The goal is to automate this process and alert the owner if a receipt is missing or mismatched. Our approach is to build a system that can match receipts to bank statements, detect mismatches, and classify valid purchases into a specific category. The information of the valid purchases will then be added into a Vendor Expense Claim sheet. From my academic perspective, this project combines different concepts from natural language processing, databases, and software engineering to create a useful tool. I believe this application has the potential to improve financial workflows by making expense management more accurate and efficient.

The classes I have taken at UC have provided me with a strong foundation for this project. Last spring, I took **EECE 3093C - Software Engineering**, where I learned about the software development life cycle, including best practices for design, testing, and more. I believe the skills gained in this course will help us organize and manage the project effectively. I am currently taking **CS 6073 - Deep Learning** and **EECE 6036 - Intelligent Systems**, where I am learning about machine learning models, neural networks, and AI techniques. The knowledge from these courses will be directly applicable to developing the NLP/ML methods needed for purchase classification and receipt-statement matching. These courses, along with others I have taken, provide me with strong technical and problem-solving skills to contribute effectively to this project.

My co-op experiences have provided me with the hands-on skills necessary to contribute to this senior design project. At Wells Fargo, as a Software Engineering Intern, I worked on building an LLM agent to process ServiceNow alerts, summarize them, and suggest next steps. I also helped design and orchestrate a multi-agent system to automate vulnerability ticket workflows. This experience in building and managing intelligent agents gives me relevant skills for this project. During my co-ops at Kinetic Vision as a Software Engineering Intern, I gained full-stack development experience, using technologies like React.js and GraphQL to build robust and reliable applications. These experiences will guide my contributions to the development and implementation of our project. Beyond technical experience, my co-op roles also strengthened my problem-solving and collaboration skills.

I am motivated to work on this project because it addresses a real-world problem that many businesses face, which is managing receipts and expense claims effectively. Additionally, this project combines many areas I am interested in and aligns closely with my technical interest in building AI-driven applications. I am particularly excited about exploring how NLP can be applied to organize and classify financial data. This project also provides a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience and strengthen my skills with tools widely used in the industry such as AWS. At the same time, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of system architecture and how components interact in an end-to-end workflow. I am also excited to work with engineers from Midea and learn from the team throughout the development process.

For this project, our preliminary approach will start with processing receipts and bank statements, building matching algorithms to ensure accuracy. From there, we will apply NLP techniques to classify purchases and populate an Vendor Expense Claim Excel sheet with structured, validated information. We will leverage AWS services for automation and scalability while integrating Mideaâ€™s internal AI tool. I expect the final application to allow users to upload receipts and bank statements, automatically validate them, classify transactions, and add them to the sheet. I plan to evaluate the system by testing how reliably it detects mismatches and classifies expenses. I will know I have done a good job when my work contributes to a functional system that meets the goals of our project.
