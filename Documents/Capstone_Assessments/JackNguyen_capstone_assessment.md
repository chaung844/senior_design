For my senior design project, my team and I are collaborating on Midea’s capstone project, which focuses on developing a system that can automatically cross check bank statements with receipts. The system will look at purchases, identify mismatches, predict categories for expenses, and generate a vendor expense claim Excel sheet with structured details. From my perspective, this project represents a great opportunity for me to apply artificial intelligence, data processing, and natural language processing to a real-world business setting. It requires careful design to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, all of which tie directly to skills I have built throughout my undergraduate studies. I am particularly interested in how we can leverage tools like Python NLP libraries and AWS services to solve a practical industry problem.

My academic coursework has given me the technical foundation needed to approach this project. In my Deep Learning class with Professor Gowtham Atluri, I learned how to design and train models that recognize patterns in unstructured data, which will be critical when handling OCR outputs from receipts. Courses in Algorithms and Data Structures taught me problem-solving strategies and optimization techniques that will be useful for designing fast and accurate matching algorithms. Though I’m sure I’m forgetting to mention some specific classes, my coursework here at UC has trained me to work systematically through multi-step problems, a discipline that will be invaluable when structuring the stages of reconciliation, classification, and reporting required by this project.

My co-op experiences have directly prepared me for this capstone project by exposing me to AI development, data transformation, and real-world problem-solving. At iCode Edu, where I worked as a Game Development tutor, I honed communication and instructional skills by teaching kids to create a simple runner game in Unity, learning to explain technical processes clearly and effectively. At Discovery Lab Global, I trained an AI to play and win the game of Pong, which introduced me to reinforcement learning and iterative model improvement. At UNIT Technology in Vietnam, I collaborated on a project to convert raw, handwritten forms into structured Markdown and JSON files using OCR and AI models. This experience is especially relevant to Midea’s project, since receipt and bank statement reconciliation also relies on accurate data transformation and validation. Across these roles, I strengthened both technical skills—such as AI training and preprocessing—and non-technical skills like teamwork, adaptability, and project communication. All of these experiences will allow me to contribute effectively to the technical and collaborative requirements of this capstone.

I am highly motivated to participate in this project because it sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and practical problem-solving. Unlike academic exercises, this project has a direct impact on business efficiency by reducing the manual labor required to verify receipts and reconcile accounts. I am excited by the challenge of working with unstructured financial documents, where accuracy comes first and errors could have significant consequences. My prior experiences with OCR and AI model development have already shown me the potential of these tools to transform raw information into structured insights, and this project represents the next step in applying those techniques to a new domain. I am also motivated by the opportunity to work with mentors from Midea, and develop my interpersonal skills in a more formal business setting.

Our preliminary approach to the project involves breaking the work into stages: first, extracting and preprocessing receipt and bank statement data using OCR tools; second, applying natural language processing techniques to match transactions and flag mismatches; third, predicting expense categories; and finally, generating a structured vendor expense claim in Excel. I plan to contribute by leveraging my background in AI model training and data processing to design efficient preprocessing pipelines and classification models. We expect our results to include a prototype system capable of accurately cross-checking receipts, predicting categories, and producing reliable reports. To evaluate my contributions, I will measure success via the system’s accuracy in matching receipts to statements, the precision of its category predictions, and feedback from team members and our advisor on usability and reliability. I will know I have done a good job when the system performs consistently on real financial data and the team is confident presenting it as a functional, industry-ready solution.
