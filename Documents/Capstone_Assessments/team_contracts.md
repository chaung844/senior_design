### Problem 
  - Cross-check receipts with bank statements.
  - Ensure the receipt amount matches the bank statement amount.
  - If a receipt is missing or mismatched, a warning system should alert the owner.
  - When amounts match, purchases must be classified into specific categories.

### Proposed Solution 
  - Develop a system that can automatically:
    - Match receipts to corresponding bank statement entries.
    - Detect and flag missing or mismatched receipts.
    - Predict categories for valid purchases using NLP/ML methods.
    - Populate a structured Vendor Expense Claim Excel sheet with validated and classified data.

### Proposed Stack
  - Python NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, or Hugging Face Transformers)
  - Internal AI tool provided by Midea
  - AWS services (e.g., AWS Bedrock for LLMs, AWS S3 for file storage, AWS Lambda for automation, etc.)
